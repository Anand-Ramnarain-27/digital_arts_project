Inspirations

Drawing from iconic cyberpunk aesthetics and classic platforming games, Hacker Vs Cyberspace is a testament to creativity and technical skill in game development.

## About this Game & Why

My game draws its core gameplay inspiration from Super Meat Boy, Broforce and Arcade beat you score/time game. Like Super Meat Boy, I wanted to combine the intense, challenging platforming mechanics with a strong emphasis on precise control and quick decision-making, encouraging players to learn from their mistakes and master each level. Additionally, Broforce brings a chaotic, over-the-top dynamic that makes every move feel impactful, which what I incorporated. The fast, fluid movement add to the thrill of Broforce, and while my game is more structured and precise, the emphasis on smooth, responsive movement is a shared goal.

Ultimately, my game is a blend of these influences, emphasizing fast-paced, competitive gameplay, where mastering movement and timing is crucial. Even though I’ve shifted away from the high-score chase of arcade classics, the competitive nature is still there. So, players will now strive to beat their best times and perfect their runs through increasingly challenging cyberspace levels. This keeps the game engaging, repayable, and rewarding for those who enjoy the thrill of competition.

For my game, Hacker Vs. Cyberspace, my primary project goals centre on crafting an engaging and immersive experience through polished mechanics and visuals that support the cyberpunk theme. Gameplay must feel smooth and intuitive, with responsive controls and well-balanced difficulty. I aim to establish a unique style with Tron-inspired graphics and a consistent cyberspace theme. Technically, my goals include a seamless implementation of core abilities like EMP and gravity inversion, ensuring they enhance the experience without causing performance issues. Completing each milestone as planned is essential for the project’s timely delivery and overall quality.

Personal Development Rubric
The Personal Rubric provides an objective assessment with clear criteria for evaluating my progress in skill improvement, creativity in creating an immersive experience, commitment, problem-solving, and feedback. This clarity ensures consistency in evaluations over time for me. By focusing on targeted feedback, the rubric helps identify strengths and areas for improvement, allowing concentrated efforts on specific skills, forcing me to incorporate the feedback I get into my project and find new ways to implement it as usually, I end up ignoring the feedback and just go and do what I want to. It also shows my goals clearly which also serves as motivation to achieve higher performance levels. Additionally, this rubric offers a comprehensive evaluation, covering various aspects of my personal development to ensure a well-rounded assessment and so I can improve on areas which I feel I need to focus on in my work.

Project Rubric
The Project Rubric ensures alignment with initial project goals, such as delivering smooth gameplay, sticking to the chosen art style, and implementing technical solutions. It allows me to track and focus on my milestones, ensuring the timely completion of key project stages as I usually get distracted in my work and don’t finish what I need to. Having an aspect of graphics and art in my rubric makes sure I will at least try to create art even though it is a small amount because I know I am not the best at art but it allows me to still try to make something and expand my boundaries to take my art skills somewhat further. The technical implementation, will enable me to have performance evaluations to ensure the game's reliability and player satisfaction so there is minimum lag/glitches. This will allow for continuous improvement which is important in iterative development, providing feedback on different aspects of the project and identifying specific issues that need addressing, whether technical, artistic, or related to user experience.
